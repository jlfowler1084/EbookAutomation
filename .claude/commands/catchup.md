# /catchup — Cross-Project Context Summary

**This command SCANS multiple data sources and PRODUCES an original summary. The dependency
registry is an INPUT — do not display it. The output is the structured summary populated
with data gathered from the steps below.**

## Data Gathering

Use `Get-SBCrossProjectActivity` to gather session and commit data. Do NOT use raw `find`
or `cat` — they produce inconsistent results and duplicate module logic.

### Step 1: Auto-create daily note stub

Run this PowerShell block FIRST to ensure today's daily note exists:

```powershell
$today = Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd'
$dailyNote = "F:\Obsidian\SecondBrain\Daily Notes\$today.md"
if (-not (Test-Path $dailyNote)) {
    $dayName = (Get-Date).ToString('dddd')
    $stub = @"
---
date: $today
tags: [daily]
created_by: catchup-auto-stub
---

# $today, $dayName

## Active Context
- Working on:
- Open questions:

## Cross-Project Signals
<!-- Add NEW DEPENDENCY: markers here when you discover cross-project dependencies -->

## Tasks
- [ ]

## Notes

## Connections
"@
    New-Item -Path $dailyNote -ItemType File -Value $stub -Force | Out-Null
    Write-Host "Created daily note stub: $dailyNote" -ForegroundColor Green
}
```

### Step 2: Load cross-project activity

```powershell
Import-Module 'F:\Obsidian\SecondBrain\Resources\SB-PSModules\SecondBrain.psd1' -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
$activity = Get-SBCrossProjectActivity -DaysBack 2
```

### Step 3: Read dependency registry

Read `F:\Obsidian\SecondBrain\Resources\project-dependencies.json` and find all
dependencies where EbookAutomation is either `from` or `to`.

### Step 4: Read today's daily note for dependency flags

Check if `F:\Obsidian\SecondBrain\Daily Notes\<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` exists:
- If the file does NOT exist: Step 1 should have auto-created it (existing behavior)
- If the file DOES exist: grep it for lines containing `NEW DEPENDENCY:` markers

Report one of three states under "Flagged Dependencies" in the output:
1. If file was just auto-created by Step 1: "Daily note auto-created this session; no dependencies flagged yet"
2. If file exists and has no `NEW DEPENDENCY:` markers: "None found"
3. If file exists and has markers: list each one as a bullet with context

**Never say "No daily note exists" if the file is actually on disk.**

### Step 5: Identify cross-project ticket references

From the `$activity` objects, collect all `CrossProjectRefs` arrays. Look for ticket IDs
matching other projects' Jira keys (CAR-\d+, INFRA-\d+, SCRUM-\d+, EB-\d+, HOME-\d+)
that reference work outside the current project.

## Output Format

Produce the following structured summary with these EXACT section headers IN THIS ORDER:

```markdown
# Cross-Project Context for EbookAutomation

## Dependencies
- <project>: <type> — <summary>
(list all dependencies where EbookAutomation is from or to)

## Flagged Dependencies
<One of: "Daily note auto-created this session; no dependencies flagged yet" | "None found" | bulleted list of NEW DEPENDENCY: markers>

## Recent Activity in Dependent Projects (last 48h)

### <DependentProject>
- Sessions: <count> sessions
- Commits today: <count>
- Key changes: <summary of notable changes>

### <DependentProject>
- Sessions: <count> sessions
- Commits today: <count>
- Key changes: <summary of notable changes>

(repeat for each dependent project; if no activity, state "No activity in last 48 hours")

## Open items that may affect us
- <items from session logs that reference EbookAutomation or shared interfaces>
(if none found, state "None identified")

## Recent Activity in EbookAutomation (last 48h)
- Sessions: <count>
- Commits today: <count>
- Key changes: <summary>

## Cross-Project References Detected
- <ticket> referenced in <project> commits/sessions — <brief context>
(if none, state "No cross-project references detected")

## Action Items for This Session
- <actionable items based on findings>
(if nothing actionable, state "No immediate action items")

<!-- BEGIN CATCHUP METADATA
catchup_version: 1.0
project: EbookAutomation
generated_at: <ISO 8601 timestamp>
days_back: 2
dependent_projects:
  - <name>
cross_project_refs:
  - <ticket-id>
new_dependencies: []
flagged_risks: []
END CATCHUP METADATA -->
```

If no recent activity is found for a dependent project, state "No activity in last 48 hours"
rather than omitting the project or generating filler content.

## Required Output Format

Your response MUST end with the metadata block below. This is NOT optional — the Phase 2 message bus parses this block programmatically. If you omit it, downstream automation breaks.

To generate the block, run this PowerShell snippet and paste its output verbatim at the end of your response:

```powershell
$activity = Get-SBCrossProjectActivity -DaysBack 2
$meta = [ordered]@{
    catchup_version    = '1.0'
    project            = 'EbookAutomation'
    generated_at       = (Get-Date -Format 'o')
    days_back          = 2
    dependent_projects = @($activity.Project)
    cross_project_refs = @($activity.CrossProjectRefs | Sort-Object -Unique)
    new_dependencies   = @()
    flagged_risks      = @()
}

# Prefer YAML if powershell-yaml is installed, fall back to JSON otherwise
if (Get-Module -ListAvailable powershell-yaml) {
    Import-Module powershell-yaml
    $body = $meta | ConvertTo-Yaml
} else {
    $body = $meta | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 4
}

$fence = '``' + '`'
"---`n<!-- BEGIN CATCHUP METADATA -->`n${fence}yaml`n$body`n${fence}`n<!-- END CATCHUP METADATA -->"
```

Fill `new_dependencies` with any `NEW DEPENDENCY:` markers found in today's daily note. Fill `flagged_risks` with short strings summarizing anything from the "Action Items for This Session" section that's a risk to cross-project stability.

The output block must start with `<!-- BEGIN CATCHUP METADATA -->` and end with `<!-- END CATCHUP METADATA -->` on their own lines, with a fenced yaml code block between them.
